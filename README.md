# Client_server_application
A Client Server Application in C Using Unix Sockets and Threads

# About the application

This project involves the development and test of a simple **Remote System
Information Service client and server**, coded in C on Linux which can exchange messages
using **TCP synchronous sockets**. All development are in C. The development and
deployment environment are **Linux Mint 17.3 64 bit**.

This service employs **TCP synchronous sockets** to allow access by its connected
clients i.e. data generated by the server (e.g. the server time value) must be transmitted to
the client via a socket and displayed there to the user. The server will be **multi-threaded**.
Although more than one client can connect to the server at the same time, you do not
have to consider any further concurrency issues in this coursework.
