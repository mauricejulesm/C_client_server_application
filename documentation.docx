A Client Server Application in C Using Unix Sockets and Threads

1. About the application

This project involves the development and test of a simple **Remote System
Information Service client and server**, coded in C on Linux which can exchange messages
using **TCP synchronous sockets**. All development are in C. The development and
deployment environment are **Linux Mint 17.3 64 bit**.

This service employs **TCP synchronous sockets** to allow access by its connected
clients i.e. data generated by the server (e.g. the server time value) must be transmitted to
the client via a socket and displayed there to the user. The server will be **multi-threaded**.
Although more than one client can connect to the server at the same time, you do not
have to consider any further concurrency issues in this coursework. 

2. How to Run The Application.

For this application to run, it depends on the server that must be running. The user interacts with the client application which talks to the server in background in sockets and it is threaded. 

2.1. Running the Server

First, run you Linux machine
Open the terminal and navigate to the main the directory where the server and client reside
Type cd server
Type make to compile the server code
Type ./server to run the server.
Leave server terminal running and don't close it.

2.1. Running the Client

Open a new terminal window ( make sure you are in the application's main directory).
Type cd client to navigate to the client's code
Type make to compile the client's code
type ./client to run the client.
A menu will be opened; 
Choose a number related to the action you want to do as you see them on the client menu
